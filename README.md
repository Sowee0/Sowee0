Hey everyone! I'm Gabriel, a masters student @ UNICAMP. At this moment we're working with convolutive neural networks for various image processing purposes.

I'm interested in low level coding such as embedded projects, HDL for FPGAs (Verilog!) and at this moment, neural networks.

At this moment I'm trying to expand my coding horizons learning Rust. I'm also interested in learning more about interfacing with web services and APIs.

I'd love to collaborate on open source projects.

Thanks for reading!
